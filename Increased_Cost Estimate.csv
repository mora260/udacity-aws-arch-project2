"* AWS Pricing Calculator provides only an estimate of your AWS fees and doesn't include any taxes that might apply. Your actual fees depend on a variety of factors, including your actual usage of AWS services."

This totals to 16201.95 USD monthly.

Additionaly, the estimated cost of the CloudFront distribution was calculated with https://calculator.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html, since it does not appear in the other calculator.

The CloudFront monthly estimate is: 1349.25 USD

The final total ends up in: 17521.2 USD

What resources will you add and why?

I'll add a second configuration in Ohio (second region), to have higher reducancy on the services.
Now we have a multi-az, mutli-region configuration.
This will guarantee that the application will continue to run even on a region outage in N. Virginia or Ohio (but no simultaneously).
Also all the S3 data files were put on standard since the higher budget permits it. Lifecycles can still me implemented to save some money, but the budget increase now makes it possible to have files in quicker access times.

The EC2 instances were promoted to a new instance type, to be able to manager higher workloads.
The DB instances also were promoted to better machines and know have more memory available.

Even with all the reducancy added, and the performance improvements, the bill didn't reach the 18000 USD. I will not push it, since i think it is nothing more can be improved at the time.

Also the estimates were done with a constant of data trasnfer assumed for the 55000 users.
No modification to the data transfer estimations were made for any of the architecture estimates.

Maybe if the budget increase was in response of a user increase, so this numbers will need to change.
In that case, additional estimations will be needed to guarantee that this modifications are possible and everything will still be in budget.
