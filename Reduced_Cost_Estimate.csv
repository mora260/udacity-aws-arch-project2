"* AWS Pricing Calculator provides only an estimate of your AWS fees and doesn't include any taxes that might apply. Your actual fees depend on a variety of factors, including your actual usage of AWS services."

This totals to 5339.89 USD monthly.

Additionaly, the estimated cost of the CloudFront distribution was calculated with https://calculator.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html, since it does not appear in the other calculator.

The CloudFront monthly estimate is: 819.74 USD

The final total ends up in: 6159.63 USD

The most important changes made to manage the budget reduction were:

1. Remove the read only replica of the Db. This replica improves data performance reducing network costs and improving workload on the master db, but it is expensive to mantain.
   Maybe downtime will be longer in case of a disaster, since we can't promote the read replica to master, but the savings are near 1000 USD per month.
2. Move some of the storage of standard S3 to One Zone Infrequent Access. With this change some of the old files from the social network will be moved to other tier, resulting in significant savings.
3. The EC2 amount of instances during peaks were reduced from 8 to 5. This is a potential saving.
4. The EC2 instances were changed from t3.large to t3.medium, and were put in a upfront plan for one year.
   With this the monthly costs of EC2 for Web servers and Applications servers were both reduced from 538 USD to 312 USD.
   Incurring only in a upfront fee of 425.74 USD.
